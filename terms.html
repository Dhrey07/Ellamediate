                        <p>
                            Purpose of the Services. The purpose of the Services is to enable you own assets and earn returns on the fraction of assets you own. Once you authorise us to debit your account or debit card, we proceed with the debit (the amount you specify). Your returns on ownership fractions are paid at set pay-out days. We understand that some of our Users might want their returns paid into foreign accounts. We already have in place a system to ensure its seamless process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Users Funds. Ellamediate does not hold the Users funds as all funds in your Ellamediate Account are held by our Fiduciary Partners who hold the funds in trust for the Users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Transfer of Funds. Users will be unable to transfer the funds in their Ellamediate Account until the Users have fully paid for 1 (one) lot of their asset of interest. We will generally transfer the requested funds from your Ellamediate Account to your Bank Account within 25 (Twenty-five) business days upon the fulfilment of the above condition and upon receipt of your request. It is important to know the amount of available funds in your Ellamediate Account before instructing us to transfer funds from your Ellamediate Account to your Bank Account. If you do not have sufficient available funds in your Ellamediate Account or an amount totalling at least the cost of 1 (one) lot to cover the amount of the requested transfer, your request for the transfer will be declined. We may also transfer funds from your Ellamediate Account to your Bank Account without notice to you upon the closure of your Ellamediate Account and at any time if required by applicable law or if we, in our sole discretion, suspect the Services are being used for illicit purposes or otherwise in violation of these Terms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Funds in Your Ellamediate Account. The funds in your Ellamediate Account are for the sole purpose of purchasing and owning fractions of assets listed on our platform. You may not use the funds in your Ellamediate Account for other purchases outside the sole purpose as stated above. NO THIRD-PARTY EXCHANGE except as permitted on the Exchange Platform (“Exchange Platform” means the platform where you are permitted to sell the fraction of asset you own).  You are solely responsible for determining whether the funds debited from your debit card and the funds maintained in your Ellamediate Account are acceptable to you. We are not responsible for any third-party fees that may be incurred as a result of using the Services, including, but not limited to, third-party fees incurred as a result of maintaining insufficient funds in your Bank Account.
